# Ombori React App Challenge

Welcome to my submission for the Ombori full-stack position code test. This project exceeds the initial guidelines provided by Ombori, showcasing advanced features and best practices to create a responsive, efficient, and user-friendly web application.

## Features

- **Custom Loading Component**: Displays a custom loading animation for 3 seconds, enhancing user experience with smooth transitions.
- **Data Fetching from reqres.in**: Utilizes [reqres.in API](https://reqres.in/) to fetch user data asynchronously.
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Implements infinite scrolling to lazy load more users, optimizing performance by loading data as needed.
- **End of List Indicator**: Informs users when no more data is available, improving usability of infinite scroll.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application looks great and functions well on various devices, with a focus on mobile screens.
- **Data Caching with React Query**: Leverages React Query for data fetching, caching, and keeping data fresh, significantly improving app performance.
- **Material-UI Integration**: Uses Material-UI as the UI library for designing components, showcasing modern and clean design.
- **Global State Management with Redux**: Manages application state using Redux, demonstrating effective state management practices.
- **Light and Dark Mode**: Adds support for light and dark modes, providing personalized user experience.
- **Homepage with Typewriter Effect**: Features an additional homepage with welcoming text using a typewriter effect, engaging users from the start.
- **React Router**: Utilizes React Router for SPA experience, with a main route ('/') and a users directory page ('/users').
- **Lazy Loading of Images**: Implements lazy loading for images within the users directory, ensuring images are loaded efficiently and only as needed, further optimizing performance.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Follows the recommended linting setup to ensure code quality, readability, and consistency across the project. This includes enforcing rules for TypeScript and React, promoting best practices and preventing common errors.

## Running the Project

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Use Git to clone the project's repository to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the command `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
   - If you encounter any dependency issues during installation, use the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to bypass peer dependency conflicts.
3. **Start the development server**:
   - Execute the command `npm start` to launch the development server.
   - Once the server is running, your default web browser should open automatically to `http://localhost:3000`, where you can view the application.

By following these instructions, you should be able to successfully run the project on your local environment and explore its features.

## Linting Configuration

The project includes an ESLint configuration tailored for a TypeScript and React codebase, ensuring adherence to best practices and industry standards. If you wish to modify or extend the linting rules, refer to the ESLint documentation and the `.eslintrc.json` file in the project root.

## Conclusion

This application showcases my ability to build modern, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. By incorporating advanced features and best practices, it demonstrates my skill set and how I can contribute to the Ombori team. I look forward to any feedback and the opportunity to discuss my submission further.
